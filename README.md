# Cloud Security Checks

Multi-Cloud Security Evaluation and Optimization Framework

Cloud Security Checks is a modular, vendor-agnostic toolkit for evaluating, optimizing, and operationalizing cloud security across Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It standardizes the process of assessing coverage, integration, compliance, cost efficiency, and feature enablement across each cloud environment. The framework enables Security Engineering, SOC, and FinOps teams to identify security gaps, redundant spend, and improvement opportunities through consistent metrics and automated data collection.
